# Plant Disease Detection using TensorFlow

This project develops an advanced deep learning pipeline for automated plant disease detection using TensorFlow and ResNet-based transfer learning. Leveraging the New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented), the model learns to accurately classify various plant diseases from leaf images, enabling early detection and supporting better agricultural practices.

The project benefits farmers, agricultural researchers, and precision farming systems by reducing dependency on manual disease identification and accelerating disease management in crops.

**Key Advantages:**  
- Uses state-of-the-art TensorFlow/Keras APIs for preprocessing and augmentation  
- Leverages ResNet transfer learning for powerful feature extraction and fine-tuning  
- Works with a large, augmented dataset to avoid overfitting  
- Provides a foundation for real-world deployment in smart farming solutions
