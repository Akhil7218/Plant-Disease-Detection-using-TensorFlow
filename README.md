# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-TensorFlow
This project implements a Plant Disease Detection system using deep learning techniques. The model classifies plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories based on input images. This helps farmers and agricultural researchers in identifying plant diseases early and improving crop yield.
